# HTML

_HyperText Markup Language_ is a declarative, domain-specific, markup language used to add structure and meaning to the content within a web page - **it is the foundation of the world wide web**.

- **Hypertext** is reference to the links which connect pages to each other - these links create the 'web'.
- **Markup** is used to annotate content(text, images etc,) - the browser recognises the markup tags and displays the page.
- **Language** because the markup used includes special elements which are the building blocks of a webpage.
