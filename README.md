# HTML

_HyperText Markup Language_ is a declarative, domain-specific, markup language used to add structure and meaning to the content within a web page; **iit is the fundamental building block of the world wide web.**

- **Hypertext** is reference to the links which connect pages to each other - these links create the 'web'.
- **Markup** is used to annotate content(text, media, etc.) - the browser recognises the markup tags and displays the content.
- **Language** because the markup used includes special elements which are the building blocks of a webpage, it is a languace classification.
