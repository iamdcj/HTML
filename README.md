# HTML

_HyperText Markup Language_ is a declarative, domain-specific, markup language used to add structure and meaning to webpages.

- **Hypertext** is reference to the links which connect pages to each other - these links create the web.
- **Markup** is used to annotate content(text, images etc,) - the browser recognises the markup tags and displays the page.
- **Language** because the markup used includes special elements which are the building blocks of a webpage.
