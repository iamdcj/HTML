# HTML

_HyperText Markup Language_ is a declarative, domain-specific, markup language used to add structure and meaning to webpages.

- **Hypertext** is reference to the links which connect pages to each other - these links create the web.
- **Markup** is used to annotate content(text, images etc,) - the browser recognises the markup tags and displays the page.
- **Language** because the markup used includes special elements which are the building blocks of a webpage.


#### What's in a Document? 
An HTML document contains content which is 'marked-up' using the HTML language's elements, these elements describe what the content is, thus informing the browser how to render the content within;

`<p>I am a paragraph, and the browser knows what to do with me.</p>`
