# The section element

The `<section />` element's purpose is to provide a generic wrapper for sectioning content within the document.

It is good to use when there isn't a more semantic element for its containing flow content.

### Display value: **BLOCK**

The `<section />` element is block level; it doesn't naturally tolerate elements on the same line.

### Content category: **Flow**

### Example

The following example demonstrates how the `<section />` element can be used to divide content in an HTML document;

```
<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>something something David Jones</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Experience</h3>
  <p>something something David Jones</p>
</section>
```
