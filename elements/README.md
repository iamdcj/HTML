# HTML elements

The elements in an HTML document are the building blocks of a webpage; the building blocks of the building block.

They wrap around the content; text or multimedia; image, video or audio present in a document, providing meaning and structure to the page.

Some HTML elements are specific to the content they contain, others are more general purpose, usually wrap related elements in a common container.

### Structure

HTML elements consist of an opening tag `<div>`, some content, and a closing tag `</div>`;

`<div>content</div>`

### Nesting Elements

HTML elements can be placed inside other elements - this is called nesting.

Example
The following example consists of a paragraph<p> tag and a nested <em> tag:

<p>My name is David, however I <em>love</em> being called <strong>Dave </strong></p>

Rules of nesting
In the above example you can see that nested elements must be closed first; the <em> element is closed, then the <strong> element, finally the <p> element.

It is essential to close the nested elements in the correct order, else the browserâ€™s error handling will take effect, and dependant on the browser engine you could get unexpected, and usually negative results.

### VOID / Self-closing Elements

There are some elements which deviate from the standard structure; they only consist of a single tag, and this tag makes up the element - these are referred to as empty/void/self-closing elements.

The most common 'void' element is arguably the image element; <img> - there is a least one of these present in most web pages on the WWW.

The lack of closing tag prevents them from wrapping/containing content, so the content is instead provided to the element via an [attribute](../attributes)
