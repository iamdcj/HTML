# The div element

The `<div />` element's purpose is to provide a division between content. It is good to use when there isn't a more semantic element fit for purpose.

### Display value: **BLOCK**

The `<div />` element is block level; it doesn't naturally tolerate elements on the same line.

### Content category: **Flow**

### Example

The following example demonstrates how the `div`ision element can be used to divide content

```
<div>
  I'm an island
</div>

<div>
  Me too
</div>
```
