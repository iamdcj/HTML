# HTML Content Categories

Content categories loosely define an [element's](../../elements) expected containing content.

A number of elements are expected to contain a particular type of content, it is this expected content that determines an element's content category, for example;

The `<link />` element typically sits within the `<head />` element, and contains metadata content which can modify the document's behaviour or appearance; this expectedly falls into the **Metadata Content** category.
